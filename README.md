# Investigating environment factors which influence national prescribing patterns

## Project Summary

The National Health Service (NHS) is increasingly challenged by the impacts of climate-related extreme weather events such as floods, heatwaves and storms. These events can disrupt access to healthcare, affect medication supply and alter patterns of prescribing across communities. This short-term project will explore the feasibility of linking practice-level NHS prescribing data with local flooding and weather records to investigate how primary care activity responds to environmental shocks. The results will provide early evidence to support a future NIHR Climate Change and Health Research Collaboration application focused on health system resilience and adaptation.

## Aims and Objectives

The project will undertake a preliminary analysis to:

1.	Identify and obtain relevant data sources on local flooding (e.g. Environment Agency flood alerts, Recorded Flood Outlines, and Met Office rainfall data).
2.	Clean, harmonise and link these datasets with NHS practice-level prescribing data (e.g. via OpenPrescribing or NHSBSA ePACT2).
3.	Quantify associations between extreme weather or flood events and changes in prescribing rates—particularly for medications sensitive to disruption (e.g. antibiotics, cardiovascular and respiratory drugs).
4.	Explore spatial variation and social inequalities in these patterns using deprivation indices and regional vulnerability metrics.
5.	Produce a short report outlining findings, data linkage feasibility, and methodological recommendations for a larger multi-year study on climate resilience in health care delivery.

## Impact

This project will generate valuable preliminary evidence on how extreme weather affects routine healthcare delivery and inform the design of larger-scale NIHR-funded research into climate adaptation. It will contribute to a growing area of urgent national importance—understanding and strengthening the resilience of health and social care systems in the face of climate change.
